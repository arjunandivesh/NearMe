                Perambur is a well-established neighbourhood located in the northern region of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, with a pin code of 600011.
 The name "Perambur" originates from the Tamil words "pirambu" (bamboo) and "oor" (place), reflecting its historical identity as a bamboo forest before British rule, particularly around the Huzur Gardens area, which now houses the Simpsons Pvt. Ltd..
 It was annexed to Chennai in 1742 CE and is among the earliest British settlements in the city, primarily due to the development of railway infrastructure in the 1850s.
