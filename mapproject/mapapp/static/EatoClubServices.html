               The provided context does not contain information about Eaton Club services in Chennai. Eaton Club is a premium flexible workspace provider in Hong Kong with locations in Central, Wan Chai, and Mong Kok, offering services such as coworking spaces, serviced offices, event spaces, meeting rooms, and virtual offices.

In contrast, the information related to Chennai pertains to Eaton Corporation, a separate entity, which has manufacturing and distribution activities in the city. This includes a new Rs 200 crore facility for manufacturing, research, and development of high-end power management equipment, expected to be completed by the end of 2026.
 Additionally, several distributors in Chennai, such as Paramhans Industry and BE Electricals, supply Eaton products like MCCBs, contactors, ELCBs, MPCBs, PLCs, switchgear, and transmission components.
